could possibly look at the metabolite that these archaea use and try to infer what metabolite the diatom archaea buddies are using from their associations

could chart halophilic preferences of archaea and see if taxa sister to the diatom archaea share or differ in halophilic preferences

could also use the aerobic preferences of the taxa
